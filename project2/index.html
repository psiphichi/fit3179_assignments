          This site shows global economic data with visualisations
          and provides some insights into it.
          Let's first take a look at the map below.
          The map shows the annual GDP growth rate in a percentage
          based on the price in 2005 by country.
          Although this data itself may be slightly outdated,
          it will still give an idea of which countries tend to have
          higher/lower growth rates.
          For example, developing countries in Asia and Africa tend to have
          higher growth rate, while developed countries such as Western European nations
          have lower values.
          Use the bottom left slider and the map centre drop-down to select the centre
          and zoom in.

        <div class="comment">
          Now, let's have a look at the following map,
          which shows the population density per km<sup>2</sup> in 2017 by country.
          By comparing with the first map, you can see that 
          the population density and the GDP growth rates has 
          a positive correlation to some extent.
          The notable examples are Ethiopia, China and India.
          This observation should be reasonable as 
          the population growth will usually increase the production within
          that given nation, which means a rise in GDP.

        <div class="comment">
          Here are scatterplot matrix showing the correlations of the population,
          GDP, and CO2 emission by country.
          These 3 attributes have been chosen based on the correlation analysis
          on the original data, which revealed that these 3 have high correlations
          to each other.
          At a glance, the charts may seem cluttered and do not show high correlations,
          but you may zoom in to take a closer look at them.
          By doing so, you should be able to realise the correspondence between
          those 3.
          The bottom left filter can be used to see the values based on different regions
          to observe the differences between them.

          To have a clearer insight,
          let's take a look at each of the 3 attributes separately.
          2 charts right below show the top countries by population
          and GDP respectively.

          As you can see, China, USA, India, Brazil, Russia, Mexico and Japan
          are in both 2 charts. 
          By paying attention to the regions of those countries,
          you can see that African countries with a large populations
          are not in the GDP chart, which shows the relatively low
          standard of their economic status.
          On contrary, none of the Western European nations in the GDP chart 
          is in the population chart, which is a reflection of 
          the high productivity in those countries.

            This chart on the left shows the top countries
            by the amount of CO2 emission.
            Here, you can see that countries with
            a large amount of CO2 emission are
            either ones with large populations
            or oil rich-ones.
            It is notable that China 
            is producing by far larger amount of emissions
            compared to India, at least more than 4 times larger,
            even though the population is almost the same.
            Russia and Saudi Arabia are ranked high
            primarily because of their large production
            of oil and other resources.
            Again, European nations except Russia
            tend to have high GDPs with smaller emissions,
            and this can be explained by their 
            strict eco-friendly policies led by the EU.
